# BasicCNN

### Introduction

This project delves into Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification, emphasizing hands-on learning. We implement a basic CNN architecture using TensorFlow, focusing on architecture design, data generation, and result assessment. Through model training and visualization, we explore fundamental CNN concepts applicable to various image classification tasks. By the project's end, we aim to provide a foundational understanding of CNNs, empowering further exploration in computer vision and deep learning.
